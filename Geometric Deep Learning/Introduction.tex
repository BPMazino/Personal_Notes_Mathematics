\subsection{Why do we want to use category theory?}

There is no unifying framework in deep learning.
Category theory can provide a unifying framework for deep learning.

\subsection{What is category theory?}

Category theory is a branch of mathematics that studies abstract structures and relationships between them.  We take  birds-eye view of mathematics and study the relationships between different mathematical structures.

Compositionality is a key idea in category theory. It permits to build bridges between different fields.

Recently many researchers have started to use category theory in deep learning.
